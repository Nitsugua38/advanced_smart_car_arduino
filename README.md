# advanced_smart_car_arduino
A smart car with obstacles detection, remote control, LEDs and sound

The car used a Servo with an HC-SR04 sensor for obstacles detection, an L298N motor driver, an Arduino Sensor Shield V5 mounted on an Arduino Uno, an IR receiver LED (and remote), a simple buzzer and an RGB LED.

Warnings: Unplug the buzzer while uploading the code to the board as I had to plug it on the TX pin; use the same pins as used in the code as almost all the others are used by libraries' timers.
